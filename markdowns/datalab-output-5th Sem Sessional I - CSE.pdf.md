Lawyers have a professional duty to preserve the confidentiality of the information they gain while representing a client. They are also supposed to act in the best interests of their client. In one case, a lawyer represented a defendant in a case involving injuries from a car accident. The claimant was badly hurt but recovering. To determine the extent of the current injury, the claimant agreed to be examined by a doctor hired by the defendant's lawyer. The doctor discovered that the claimant had a heart problem, which was almost certainly caused by the accident, and forwarded this information to the lawyer. The heart problem was serious and could cause further injury to the claimant, but the lawyer did not disclose this information to the claimant, because he was representing the defendant and disclosing this unknown injury could increase the amount the defendant would have to pay to the claimant in settlement negotiations.

**Que. 4 Study the following case study and answer the following questions. (CO2) (6 Marks)**

An apparel manufacturing company having a large number of women employees was losing sales due to various factors. The company hired a reputed marketing executive, who increased the volume of sales within a short span of time. However, some unconfirmed reports came up regarding his indulgence in sexual harassment at the workplace. After some time, a woman employee launched a formal complaint to the management against the marketing executive for sexually harassing her. Faced with the company's indifference in not taking cognizance of her grievances, she lodged an FIR with the police. Realizing the sensitivity and gravity of the situation, the company called the woman employee to negotiate. In that, she was offered a hefty sum of money to withdraw the complaint and the FIR and to give in writing that the marketing executive was not involved in the case.

- a. What are the ethical issues involve in above case?**
- b. What are the options available with you (woman employee) in such a situation?**
- c. Suggest the course of action you (as a woman) would have undertaken?**

| Q1.a)        | <p>Read the following case study, which describes the data requirements for a video rental company. The video rental company has several branches throughout the USA. The data held on each branch is the branch address made up of street, city, state, and zip code, and the telephone number. Each branch is given a branch number, which is unique throughout the company. Each branch has allocated staff, which includes a Manager. The Manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of a given branch. The data held on a member of staff is his or her name, position, and salary. Each member of staff is given a staff number, which is unique throughout the company. Each branch has a stock of videos. The data held on a video is the video number, title, category, daily rental, cost, status, and the names of the main actors and the director. The video number uniquely identifies each video. A video is given a category such as Action, Adult, Children, Drama, Horror, or Sci-Fi. The status indicates whether a specific copy of a video is available for rent. Before hiring a video from the company, a customer must first register as a member of a local branch. The data held on a member is the first and last name, address, and the date that the member registered at a branch. Each member is given a member number, which is unique throughout all branches of the company. Once registered, a member is free to rent many videos. The data held on each video rented is the rental number and the dates the video was rented out and returned. The rental number is unique throughout the company.</p> <p><b>Draw an ER diagram of above above-specified description with the following questions:</b></p> <p>(i) Identify the main entity types of the video rental company with their candidate or primary key, attributes and associate them with entity or relationship types.</p> <p>(ii) Identify the main relationship types between the entity types described in (a) along with their cardinality.</p> <p>State any assumptions necessary to support your design.</p> | (2.5+2.5)<br>[CO 1]     |

Q1 Calculate the total time required to transfer a 1.5 MB file in the following cases, assuming an RTT of 80 msec, a packet size of 1 KB data, and an initial 2 x RTT of “handshaking” before data is sent: [5] CO1, CO3, CO4

- i. The bandwidth is 10 Mbps, and data packets can be sent continuously.
- ii. The bandwidth is 10 Mbps but after we finish sending each packet we must wait one RTT before sending the next.

Q2(A) What are the propagation time and the transmission time for a 2.5-kbyte message (an e-mail) if the bandwidth of the network is 1 Gbps? Assume that the distance between the sender and the receiver is 12,000 km and that light travels at  $2.4 \times 10^8$  m/s. [2] CO1, CO4

Sessional Exam - 1

Duration: 1 hour

Semester – V

Date: Aug 31, 2023 (Thu)

Max. Marks: 15

### **Important Instructions:**

- This is a closed book, closed notes examination.
- This question paper comprises total 4 questions.
- All the questions are compulsory.

Q1 a) Suppose you have an array of 1234 records in which only a few are out of order and they are not very far from their correct positions. Which sorting algorithm (among merge, insertion, heap, quick, and bubble) would you see to put the whole array in order? Justify your choice. (2M) CO1  
CO2  
CO3

b) A has  $n$  dollars (\$). Everyday A buys one of a Bun (\$1), an Ice-Cream (\$2) or a Pastry (\$2). How many ways are there (sequences) for A to spend his money? Derive the recurrence relation for the same. (1M) CO1

c) How many ones does the following procedure print when run with input  $n$ ? (1M) CO1

```
Ones(n):  
    if n = 0:  
        print 1  
    else:  
        for i = 1 to  $2^n$ :  
            Ones(n-1)
```

Read the upper bound on the for loop as  $2^n$ .

d) Consider the following TroubleSort algorithm as follows: (1M) CO1  
CO2  
CO3

```
TroubleSort(L): L is a 0-indexed list of integers  
let done = false  
while not done:  
    done = true  
    for i = 0 to  $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$ :  
        if  $L[2i] > L[2i+1]$ :  
            done = false  
            swap( $L[2i]$ ,  $L[2i+1]$ ) or reverse sublist from  $L[2i]$  to  $L[2i+1]$ , inclusive  
    return L
```

Consider the input list [5, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 8] for Troublesort algorithm. How many times swap operation will be performed between  $L[i]$  and  $L[i+2]$  ?

Q2 Take the following list of functions and arrange them in ascending order of growth rate. That is, if function  $g(n)$  immediately follows function  $f(n)$  in your list, then it should be the case that  $f(n)$  is  $O(g(n))$ . (2M) CO1

$$\begin{aligned}f_1(n) &= 10^n \\f_2(n) &= n^{1.3} \\f_3(n) &= n^n \\f_4(n) &= \log_2 n \\f_5(n) &= 2^{\sqrt{\log_2 n}}\end{aligned}$$

Q3 Suppose you are given an array  $A$  with  $n$  entries, with each entry holding a  $A[n]$  is unimodal: For some index  $p$  between 1 and  $n$ , the values in the array entries increase up to position  $p$  in  $A$  and then decrease the remainder of the way until position  $n$ . (So if you were to draw a plot with the array position  $j$  on the  $x$ -axis and the value of the entry  $A[j]$  on the  $y$ -axis, the plotted points would rise until  $x$ - (3M) CO1  
CO2  
CO3

You'd like to find the "peak entry"  $p$  without having to read the entire Array - in fact, by reading as few entries of  $A$  as possible. Show how to find the entry  $p$  by reading at most  $O(\log n)$  entries of  $A$ .

Q4 Given an array of  $n$  numbers, your task is to calculate the **maximum subarray sum**, i.e., the largest possible sum of a sequence of consecutive values in the array. (5M) CO1  
The problem is interesting when there may be negative values in the array. CO2  
For example, in the array CO3

|    |   |   |    |   |   |    |   |
|----|---|---|----|---|---|----|---|
| -1 | 2 | 4 | -3 | 5 | 2 | -5 | 2 |
|----|---|---|----|---|---|----|---|

the following subarray produces the maximum sum 10:

|    |   |   |    |   |   |    |   |
|----|---|---|----|---|---|----|---|
| -1 | 2 | 4 | -3 | 5 | 2 | -5 | 2 |
|----|---|---|----|---|---|----|---|

We assume that an empty subarray is allowed, so the maximum subarray sum is always at least 0.

Design an algorithm (or pseudocode) with:

- Time complexity  $O(n^2)$
- Time complexity  $O(n)$
